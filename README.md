# WebDevVista

WebDevVista is a single-page web application designed as a portfolio for showcasing a web developer's skills and projects. The application is built using React, providing an interactive and seamless user experience. It allows visitors to explore the developer's work, learn more about their background, and easily get in touch.

## Features

- **Single-Page Application:** WebDevVista is a single-page application, ensuring smooth navigation and a consistent user interface.

- **Header with Navigation:** The app features a header component that appears on multiple pages and includes a navigation menu. The navigation menu allows users to switch between different sections of the portfolio, such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.

- **Conditional Rendering:** The Navigation component is designed to conditionally render the corresponding sections based on the user's selection, all without requiring page reloads.

- **Portfolio Section:** The Portfolio section displays a collection of the developer's projects. Each project is represented by a Project component, showcasing the project's title, an image, and links to both the deployed application and the corresponding GitHub repository.

- **Contact Form:** The Contact section includes a contact form where visitors can reach out to the web developer. The form features fields for name, email address, and a message. It includes basic form validation, notifying the user if any field is left empty or if an invalid email address is provided.

- **Resume Section:** The Resume section presents a downloadable link to the developer's resume and lists their proficiency in various web development technologies.

- **Footer with Profile Links:** WebDevVista includes a footer component that appears on multiple pages and provides text or icon links to the developer's GitHub, LinkedIn, and another platform of their choice (e.g., Stack Overflow, Twitter).
